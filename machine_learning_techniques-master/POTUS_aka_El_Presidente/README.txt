Predicting Presidential Votes Across Counties

This is a typical example of a job interview challenge (usually given as a homework assignment to complete in a couple of hours): they will provide you with a training .csv, ask you to build some predicitve models and choose the best one; then to apply it to their test data .csv and send them the results, along with your code.
Herein find: 
-an example training set train.csv which contains metadata about counties and who won in- that county (Obama/Romney) and a test data set test.csv; 
-an R script model_selection.R that builds a variety of predictive models for the problem and chooses the one that performs best on train.csv (using repeated 10-fold cross validation); 
-an R script predict.R that that predicts the election outcome for the counties (rows) in test.csv;
-notes.txt, that explains the model building process;
-best_model.txt, that describes the performance of the best model.

Enjoy!
